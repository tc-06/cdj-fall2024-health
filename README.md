**Predicting IC50 Values from Cancer Type and Drug Administrated (EDA & Deep Learning Model)**

This repository showcases my individual work in a group project at @CornellDataJournal that analyzed a Cancer/Drug Kaggle dataset with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built several machine learning models to predict outcomes from various features. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, model development.
**My Contribution**
- Created and analyzed visualizations between IC50 values and AUC (Area Under Curve) values
- Built a Deep Neural Network model with TensorFlow to analyze input (Cancer Cell Line/Drug Type) versus output (IC50 value)
- Analyzed model performance using several metrics and visualizations
**Dataset**: [Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samiraalipour/genomics-of-drug-sensitivity-in-cancer-gdsc?resource=download)
